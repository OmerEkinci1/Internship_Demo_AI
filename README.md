# Internship_Demo_AI
Internship Demo AI part.

AI part include Python Deep Learning model and comminication between C# and it. TCP-IP connection is server-side here. Deep Learning development includes Tensorflow, Keras. This
is a multiclass image classifaction. I have 9000 datas fabric dataset and classify them between among themselves. Project take input data from external sources, evaluate and classify
then send the prediction result to TCP-IP client-side.
